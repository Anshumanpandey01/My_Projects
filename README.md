Movie Genre vs Crime Rate — Data Analysis Project

Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between movie genres and crime rates across multiple years. Using visualizations, heatmaps, and comparative trend analysis, the study explores whether certain genres show any correlation with yearly crime patterns.
The goal is to identify observable patterns using data, not to claim causation.

Objectives
Analyze yearly crime data and compare it with movie genre popularity.

Identify trends or correlations between genres and crime rates.

Use visual analytics such as bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps.

Clean and preprocess multiple datasets for combined analysis.

Generate insights showing genre influence on crime trends.

Insights Summary

Crime rates fluctuate over the years with noticeable increases and decreases.

Some movie genres appear more popular during years with higher crime activity.

Heatmap visualizations show mild correlations useful for trend interpretation.

Genre preferences shift over time and are visible through plots and graphs.


Conclusion

This project visually explores how movie genre trends align with crime rate changes over several years. While no direct causal link is claimed, the analysis provides interesting patterns for further study.
