Year-wise crime comparison with genre popularity

Visual graphs showing potential trends

Heatmaps to identify correlations

Insights about whether certain genres show higher association with crime patterns

The goal of the analysis is to explore if movie content has any observable influence on real-world crime, using data visualization and statistical techniques.
